// Keys 
// - Uniques identifiers used in lists 
// - Used to identify which items have been changed, added or removed 
// - Use stable identifiers for lists

// Uncontrolled components
// - DOM handles form data 
// Controlled components
// - Components state handles form data
// - Has value attribute attached to a state 

// Props and state
// - Both are plain javascript objects react uses to store data
// - Both trigger render updates
// Stateless component only have props 
// Stateful components have both props and state 
// - Props are immutable data sent from parent to child (immutable for the child),
// they are a components configuration
// - Props are values passed to component 
// - So state is a serialize double representation of one point in time 
// or in other words a snapshot A component manages its own state internally
// - States are managed within the component

// Context API solution for props drilling 


// Pure and Impure function 
// Functions that have side effects are impure
// A pure function should receive specific input. 
// That is a specific parameter will always return the exact same output. 
// No matter how many times it gets invoked.
